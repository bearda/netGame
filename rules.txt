This is a first draft for the rules of the game.

Objective: player1 wins if the value of the node in the middle is +5. player2 wins if it is -5.

The players place pieces on the nodes to add to their output signal. They have a limited number of + tokens and - tokens.
By placing a token on a node, the value of the node is revealed.
If the signal on the node is exactly zero, any token on top is removed (which will cause the signal to be not 0)

can this be used to avoid placing a piece? Sure.
